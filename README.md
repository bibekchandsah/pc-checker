- Optimized CSV generation with timeout protection for WMI queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Install missing packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **WMI Not Available (Non-Windows)**
   - Some advanced features will be disabled
   - Basic hardware detection still functional
   - CSV reports will have limited software information

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Run as administrator for full hardware access
   - Some temperature sensors require elevated privileges
   - Complete software inventory requires registry access

4. **Network Test Failures**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Firewall may block speedtest-cli

5. **CSV Generation Issues**
   - Ensure write permissions in application directory
   - WMI timeout protection prevents hanging on problematic queries
   - Large software lists may take extra time to process

### Error Messages
- Check the test_modules.py output for specific module errors
- GUI errors are displayed in the status bar
- Test failures show detailed error messages
